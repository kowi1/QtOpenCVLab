# QtOpenCVLab
Qt is a production ready GUI platform built with C++. 

OpenCV is an image processing platform built to efficiently run common image processing algorithms. It is built with C++.

The GUI and windowing tool shipped with OpenCV is quite limited.

This project combines the power of OpenCVs image processing library with the GUI sophistication of Qt to create an appealing end-user-application for car detection in a an image.

It should be noted that Python is a better platform for quick prototyping of applications where performance and compatibility with legacy code is no a requirement. 

The application contains.
