# QtOpenCVLab
Qt is a production ready GUI platform built with C++.


OpenCV is an image processing platform built to efficiently run common image processing algorithms. It is built with C++.



QtOpenCVLAb combines the power of OpenCV's image processing library with the GUI sophistication of Qt to create an appealing end-user-application for car detection in a an image.


OpenCV 2.4.13.6 was built from source using Qt and MingW (GCC) for compatibility reasons.
